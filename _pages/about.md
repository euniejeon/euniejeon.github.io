:wave: Hi! Iâ€™m SuhYoon Jeon, a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html) (SNU), advised by [Prof. Se Young Chun](https://icl.snu.ac.kr/pi) in the [Intelligent Computational imaging Lab](https://icl.snu.ac.kr) (ICL). I earned my B.S degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seoul National University (SNU).

Research
======
My research interests lie at the intersection of AI, computer vision, and generative modeling, with a focus on multimodal generative AI across images, videos, and 3D/4D representations, and extending to human-centric understanding and synthesis involving reconstruction, motion, and interaction.
